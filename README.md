# Abstract
A certain degree of predictability in criminal law is important for the overall functionality of the criminal justice system. For victims, the accused, and their re- latives, predictability - and the lack thereof - has a more concrete and immediate impact. The lack of predictability of how and when cases are handled, and with what outcome, installs an uncertainty of significant events for those involved in the case. This effectively limits those persons’ abilities to make decisions about their cases and their lives. Existing literature correspondingly shows that the process of a criminal case, its duration, and the uncertainty about the outcome represent a significant burden to those involved. The premise of this paper is that increasing predictability and reducing uncertainty of the handling of cases is of significant value for those involved in a criminal case. We examine how statistical models increase predictability regarding sentencing outcomes and find that our models confidently outline the likely sentencing outcomes of cases and thereby significantly reduce the uncertainty of case outcomes for the accused, the victims, and their relatives.
